The `__init__.py` file in the `markitdown_mcp` package serves as an initialization module for the package. It imports the `__version__` variable from the `__about__` module, which is typically used to define metadata about the package, including its version number. The file also defines the `__all__` list, which explicitly specifies that `__version__` is the only public attribute of the module when using the `from module import *` syntax.

The primary function of this file is to expose the `__version__` variable, which is a string representing the current version of the package. The code does not define any additional functions or classes; it solely focuses on the import and export of the version information. The only concrete dependency in this file is the `__about__` module from which `__version__` is imported.

No complex data structures, types, or interfaces are defined or manipulated within this file. The only data type present is the string type used for the `__version__` variable. Overall, this file serves a straightforward purpose of providing version information for the `markitdown_mcp` package.
