The Python file `__about__.py` in the `markitdown_mcp` package contains a single variable definition that specifies the version of the package. The code explicitly defines the `__version__` variable and assigns it the string value `"0.0.1a4"`. This versioning follows the semantic versioning format, indicating that this is an alpha release of the package.

There are no functions or classes defined in this file. The only operation implemented is the assignment of the version string to the `__version__` variable. The file does not import any external modules or libraries, nor does it interact with any external services or APIs. 

The primary data structure present in this file is the string type used for the `__version__` variable. No complex data structures, types, or interfaces are defined or manipulated within this code. The file serves a straightforward purpose of providing versioning information for the `markitdown_mcp` package.
