The `__init__.py` file in the `markitdown_sample_plugin` package serves as the initialization module for the package, defining the public interface and managing the exposure of key components. It imports specific elements from other modules within the package and specifies which of these elements are accessible when the package is imported.

The main components exposed by this file include the `__version__` and `__plugin_interface_version__` variables, which likely contain versioning information for the package and its plugin interface, respectively. Additionally, the file imports and exposes the `register_converters` function and the `RtfConverter` class, which are presumably responsible for registering conversion functionalities and handling RTF (Rich Text Format) conversions within the plugin.

The file explicitly imports from two modules: `._plugin` and `.__about__`. The `._plugin` module provides the versioning information and conversion functionalities, while the `.__about__` module supplies the package version. The data structures and types defined or manipulated in this file are primarily the aforementioned variables, function, and class, which facilitate the plugin's operational capabilities.
