The file `test_blog.html` is an HTML document structured to present a blog post titled "Does Model and Inference Parameter Matter in LLM Applications? - A Case Study for MATH | AutoGen." The document includes metadata for search engine optimization and social media sharing, such as the title, description, and author information. It provides a layout for the blog post, including a header, main content area, and a sidebar for navigation to recent posts. The content discusses the impact of model selection and inference parameters on the performance of large language models (LLMs) in solving mathematical problems.

The main content of the blog post is encapsulated within an `<article>` element, which includes various HTML tags such as headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`). The document does not define any functions or classes, as it is purely an HTML file without embedded JavaScript or server-side logic. However, it includes a script that sets the document's theme based on user preferences and manages the announcement bar's visibility. The file relies on external stylesheets and scripts, including a stylesheet from the KaTeX library for rendering mathematical expressions and custom JavaScript for additional functionality.

Concrete dependencies identified in the code include the KaTeX library for styling mathematical content, as well as custom JavaScript files (`custom.js`, `runtime~main.js`, and `main.js`) that are likely used for interactive features of the blog. The document manipulates standard HTML data structures such as `<div>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>`, which are used to organize the layout and content of the blog post. Additionally, it utilizes schema.org markup to enhance the semantic structure of the content, specifically for the blog post and author information.

## Functions and Classes

## `t`

**Location:** [`packages/markitdown/tests/test_files/test_blog.html:20`](/packages/markitdown/tests/test_files/test_blog.html#L20)

# Function Documentation: t

## Description
The function `t` is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that sets the theme of a web page based on query parameters or local storage values. It modifies the `data-theme` attribute of the `document.documentElement` (the root element of the HTML document) to reflect the selected theme. If no theme is specified, it defaults to "light".

## Parameters
- `t` (string): 
  - **Type**: String
  - **Constraints**: The value must be a valid theme name (e.g., "light", "dark").
  - **Usage**: This parameter is used to set the `data-theme` attribute of the `document.documentElement`.

## Return Value
- The function does not return a value (void). It modifies the `data-theme` attribute of the `document.documentElement` directly.

## External Dependencies
- `URLSearchParams`: This API is used to parse the query string of the current window's URL to retrieve the value associated with the key `docusaurus-theme`.
- `localStorage`: This web storage API is used to retrieve the stored theme preference under the key `theme` and `docusaurus.announcement.dismiss`.

## Usage Example
The function is invoked automatically when the script is executed. The following is an example of how the function is structured and executed:

```javascript
!function() {
    function t(t) {
        document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", t);
    }
    var e = (function() {
        try {
            return new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("docusaurus-theme");
        } catch (t) {}
    })() || (function() {
        try {
            return localStorage.getItem("theme");
        } catch (t) {}
    })();
    t(null !== e ? e : "light");
}();
```

In this example, the function `t` is called with either the value retrieved from the URL or local storage, or defaults to "light" if neither is available.
