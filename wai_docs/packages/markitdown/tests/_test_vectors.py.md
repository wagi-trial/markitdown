The Python file `packages/markitdown/tests/_test_vectors.py` implements a data structure for representing test vectors related to various file types. It defines a single class, `FileTestVector`, which is a frozen dataclass that encapsulates attributes relevant to file testing, including `filename`, `mimetype`, `charset`, `url`, `must_include`, and `must_not_include`. This class serves to standardize the representation of expected content within different file formats for testing purposes.

The `FileTestVector` class is utilized to create a list of predefined test vectors, `GENERAL_TEST_VECTORS`, which contains multiple instances of `FileTestVector`. Each instance corresponds to a specific file type such as DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PDF, HTML, CSV, JSON, XML, and ZIP. The attributes of each instance specify the expected MIME type, character set, and lists of strings that must or must not be present in the file content during testing.

The file imports the `dataclasses` module and the `List` type from the `typing` module, which are used to define the `FileTestVector` class and its attributes. The code does not interact with any external services or APIs, focusing solely on the definition and instantiation of data structures for internal testing purposes. The data structure defined is a frozen dataclass, ensuring immutability of the test vector instances once created.

# FileTestVector Class Documentation

## Overview
The `FileTestVector` class is a data structure designed to encapsulate metadata related to a file. It includes attributes for the file's name, MIME type, character set, URL, and lists of strings that specify content requirements.

## Attributes

- `filename: str`
  - Type: `str`
  - Description: Represents the name of the file. This attribute is required and must be a string.

- `mimetype: str | None`
  - Type: `str` or `None`
  - Description: Represents the MIME type of the file. This attribute is optional and can either be a string or `None`.

- `charset: str | None`
  - Type: `str` or `None`
  - Description: Represents the character set of the file. This attribute is optional and can either be a string or `None`.

- `url: str | None`
  - Type: `str` or `None`
  - Description: Represents the URL associated with the file. This attribute is optional and can either be a string or `None`.

- `must_include: List[str]`
  - Type: `List[str]`
  - Description: A list of strings that must be included in the file's content. This attribute is required and must be a list of strings.

- `must_not_include: List[str]`
  - Type: `List[str]`
  - Description: A list of strings that must not be included in the file's content. This attribute is required and must be a list of strings.

## Return Value
The `FileTestVector` class does not have a return value as it is a class definition. Instances of this class can be created to hold the specified attributes.

## Dependencies
The code does not explicitly import or depend on any external modules, APIs, or services.

## Usage Example
To create an instance of the `FileTestVector` class, the following pattern can be used:

```python
file_test_vector = FileTestVector()
file_test_vector.filename = "example.txt"
file_test_vector.mimetype = "text/plain"
file_test_vector.charset = "UTF-8"
file_test_vector.url = "http://example.com/example.txt"
file_test_vector.must_include = ["Hello", "World"]
file_test_vector.must_not_include = ["Goodbye"]
```
