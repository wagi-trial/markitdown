The `.github/workflows/tests.yml` file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "tests" that triggers on pull requests. This workflow consists of a single job called "tests" that runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. The job includes several steps to set up the environment, install dependencies, and execute tests for a specific package.

The main steps in the workflow include checking out the repository code using `actions/checkout@v5`, setting up a Python environment with multiple specified versions (3.10, 3.11, and 3.12) using `actions/setup-python@v5`, and installing the Hatch package manager via `pipx`. Finally, the workflow changes the directory to `packages/markitdown` and runs the tests using the command `hatch test`.

The workflow explicitly depends on the GitHub Actions provided by `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-python`, which are external services used to manage code checkout and Python environment setup, respectively. The file does not define any data structures, types, or interfaces, as it primarily orchestrates the execution of predefined actions and commands within the CI/CD pipeline.
