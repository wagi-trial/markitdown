The `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml` file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named `pre-commit` that triggers on pull request events. This workflow is designed to automate the process of checking code quality before changes are merged into the main branch. It consists of a single job named `pre-commit`, which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

The `pre-commit` job includes several steps. First, it checks out the repository's code using the `actions/checkout@v5` action. Next, it sets up a Python environment by utilizing the `actions/setup-python@v5` action, specifying a Python version of "3.x". The job then installs the `pre-commit` package via pip and executes the command `pre-commit install --install-hooks` to set up the necessary hooks. Finally, it runs the pre-commit checks on all files in the repository with the command `pre-commit run --all-files`.

The workflow explicitly uses the following dependencies: `actions/checkout@v5` for checking out the repository, `actions/setup-python@v5` for setting up the Python environment, and the `pre-commit` Python package for managing code quality checks. The file does not define any custom data structures, types, or interfaces; it primarily manipulates the execution of commands and the configuration of the GitHub Actions environment.
